At top is 2D scatterplot of all solutions (there will be empty space above this for our small multiples to be generated and shown here -- see below).
Each axis encodes an objective (say, sediment on Y, fire on X)
Color for each point is determined by climate scenario.
Each axis has an axis label. Clicking on the axis label changes the objective plotted on that axis.
Keep clicking on the axis label => keep cycling through the three objectives.
Each point allows data on demand.
This on-demand data includes:
	- the value of each objective at that point (tooltip)
	- the climate scenario (tooltip)
	- small-multiples maps appear across top of page: one for a value at the beginning, one showing management in the first time period, one showing management in the second time period, and one showing the end situation (again, some value).
		- The beginning and ending maps show the value of an objective, which can be changed by clicking some text
		- never made a map in D3 before. this link looks helpful: http://bost.ocks.org/mike/map/
